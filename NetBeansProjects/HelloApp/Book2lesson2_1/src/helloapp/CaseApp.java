//Types of statements. Some statements simply create variables that you can use to store data,
//they are called declaration statements and they look like this:
//int i;
//String s = "This is a string";
//Customer c = new Customer();

//expression statement, they perform calculations:
//i = a + b;
//SalesTax = invoiceTotal * taxRate;
//        System.out.println("Hello, World");
//Here the java compiler lets you know if you use a semicolon when you should'nt.
//if (total . 100)
//discountPercent =10;
//Working with Blocks
//A block is a group of one or more statement that's enclosed in braces.
//A block begins with an opening brace and ends with a closing brace.
//You can code two or more statements between the opening and closing braces:
//{
//    int i, j;
//    i = 100;
//    j = 200;
//}
//coding the braces that mark a block in two popular ways.
//One is to place both braces on seperate lines and then indent the statement that make up the block:
//if (i > 0) 
//{
//    String s = "The value of i is " + i;
//    System.out.println(s);
//}
        //You can also place the opening braces for the block on the same line as the statement the block is associate with:
// if (i > 0){    
//     String s = "The value of i is " + i;
//     System.out.println(s);
// }
    }
